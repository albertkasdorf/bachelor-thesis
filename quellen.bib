  abstract  = {The simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM) problem asks if it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and then to incrementally build a map of this environment while simultaneously using this map to compute absolute vehicle location. Starting from the estimation-theoretic foundations of this problem developed in [1]–[3], this paper proves that a solution to the SLAM problem is indeed possible. The underlying structure of the SLAM problem is first elucidated. A proof that the estimated map converges monotonically to a relative map with zero uncertainty is then developed. It is then shown that the absolute accuracy of the map and the vehicle location reach a lower bound defined only by the initial vehicle uncertainty. Together, these results show that it is possible for an autonomous vehicle to start in an unknown location in an unknown environment and, using relative observations only, incrementally build a perfect map of the world and to compute simultaneously a bounded estimate of vehicle location. This paper also describes a substantial implementation of the SLAM algorithm on a vehicle operating in an outdoor environment using millimeter-wave (MMW) radar to provide relative map observations. This implementation is used to demonstrate how some key issues such as map management and data association can be handled in a practical environment. The results obtained are cross-compared with absolute locations of the map landmarks obtained by surveying. In conclusion, this paper discusses a number of key issues raised by the solution to the SLAM problem including suboptimal map-building algorithms and map management.},

  comment   = {- While UWB positioning bears similarities to radar, there are distinct differences. For example, radar typically relies on a stand-alone transmitter/receiver, whereas a sensor network combines information from multiple sensor nodes to refine the position estimate. - Positioning systems can be divided into three main categories: time-of-arrival, direction-of-arrival, and signal-strength based systems. - angle of arrival (AOA) - signal strength (SS), path-loss - time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) - Single-/Multi-Path - In the absence of a common clock between the nodes, round-trip time between two transceiver nodes can be measured to estimate the distance between two nodes [26], [27]. - When the direct LOS between two nodes is blocked, only reflections of the UWB pulse from scatterers reach the receiving node. Therefore, the delay of the first arriving pulse does not represent the true TOA. Since the pulse travels an extra distance, a positive bias called the NLOS error is present in the measured time delay. - The main idea behind nonparametric location estimation is to gather a set of TOA measurements from all the reference nodes at known locations beforehand and use this set as a reference when a new set of measurements is obtained. => Zum Ende hin sehr Mathematisch, der Anfang biete jedoch einen guten Überblick über die verschiedenen Lokalisierungsmöglichkeiten.

It supports functions such as fusing voice and video data from different sensor nodes, time-based channel sharing, and coordinated sleep wake-up node scheduling mechanisms. Early studies on clock synchronization for WSNs mainly focused on protocol design. However, the clock synchronization problem is inherently related to parameter estimation, and, recently, studies on clock synchronization began to emerge by adopting a statistical signal processing framework. In this article, a survey on the latest advances in the field of clock synchronization of WSNs is provided by following a signal processing viewpoint. This article illustrates that many of the proposed clock synchronization protocols can be interpreted and their performance assessed using common statistical signal processing methods. It is also shown that advanced signal processing techniques enable the derivation of optimal clock synchronization algorithms under challenging scenarios.},

- This paper presents a localization system that enables a robot to self-localize based on the reception of UWB radio signals from fixed-position, wirelessly-connected modules (hereinafter referred as anchors). These anchors are placed at known locations, and periodically transmit UWB signals. By passively receiving these signals and recording their arrival times, the robot is able to self-localize relative to the anchors by using either time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-difference-ofarrival (TDOA) measurements.
- the robot is not active in the communication process and is able to self-localize, its position is not centrally tracked and anonymous operation is enabled.
- TOA algorithms calculate time of flight using the arrival time at the robot and the transmission time from the anchor, the robot’s clock must be synchronized to the anchor’s clock.
- TDOA algorithms use the difference between the arrival times of two signals, and as such, the offset of the robot’s clock is canceled. Therefore, the robot’s clock does not need to be synchronized with the anchors’ clocks.},

Smoothing approaches have been investigated as a viable alternative to extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solutions to the problem. In particular, approaches have been looked at that factorize either the associated information matrix or the measurement Jacobian into square root form. Such techniques have several significant advantages over the EKF: they are faster yet exact; they can be used in either batch or incremental mode; are better equipped to deal with non-linear process and measurement models; and yield the entire robot trajectory, at lower cost for a large class of SLAM problems. In addition, in an indirect but dramatic way, column ordering heuristics automatically exploit the locality inherent in the geographic nature of the SLAM problem. This paper presents the theory underlying these methods, along with an interpretation of factorization in terms of the graphical model associated with the SLAM problem. Both simulation results and actual SLAM experiments in large-scale environments are presented that underscore the potential of these methods as an alternative to EKF-based approaches.},

Most previous approaches to this problem employ non-probabilistic batch optimizations or delay the initialization of new beacons within a probabilistic filter until a good estimate is available. The contribution of this work is the formulation of RO-SLAM as an online Bayesian estimation process based on a RaoBlackwellized Particle Filter. The conditional distribution for each beacon is initialized using an additional particle filter which, eventually, is transformed into an extended Kalman filter when the uncertainty becomes sufficiently small. This approach allows the introduction of new beacons without either delay or any special non-probabilistic processing. We validate our proposal with experiments for both simulated and real datasets.},

- The main difference with the present work is the usage of a least-square error minimization procedure instead of a probabilistic filter.
- However, our solution has the advantages of working with any non-linearity and not requiring the explicit storage of all the map covariance matrices, with the subsequent improvement in memory usage and computation time.
- In contrast to many previous works, we apply a Bayesian filter from the beginning, taking advantage of a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) [4] to decouple the estimation of the robot poses and the map.
- we can freely choose the most convenient distribution for the beacons at each time step. We derive the equations for adding and updating a beacon to the map as a set of weighted samples, and then converting it into a Gaussian only when the distribution converges to a single location.
- Another advantage of this approach is that we maintain the best estimation of each beacon at each time step, and this information is always available to improve the robot localization. In most previous works this information cannot be exploited until the knowledge about the beacon location becomes sufficiently precise.
- for each beacon that is observed for the first time, we add a new auxiliary particle filter (PF) to each one of the RBPF samples in order to perform the Bayesian estimation of the new beacon. This auxiliary PF will eventually converge from the initial circular shape towards a small Gaussian-like shape, and at this moment it will be replaced by a standard EKF which performs reliably for reduced uncertainties.},

This technique applies a particle filter in which each particle carries an individual map of the environment. Accordingly, a key issue is to reduce the number of particles and/or to make use of compact map representations. This paper presents an approximative but highly efficient approach to mapping with Rao–Blackwellized particle filters. Moreover, it provides a compact map model. A key advantage is that the individual particles can share large parts of the model of the environment. Furthermore, they are able to reuse an already computed proposal distribution. Both techniques substantially speed up the overall filtering process and reduce the memory requirements. Experimental results obtained with mobile robots in large-scale indoor environments and based on published standard datasets illustrate the advantages of our methods over previous mapping approaches using Rao–Blackwellized particle filters.},

While this seems counter-intuitive at first, because more variables are added to the problem, the simplification arises from the fact that the smoothing information matrix is naturally sparse. Therefore, smoothing approaches provide an exact and efficient solution of the problem.

A general framework is developed which consists of three parallel threads, two of which carry out the visualinertial odometry (VIO) and UWB localization respectively. The other mapping thread integrates visual tracking constraints into a pose graph with the proposed smooth and virtual range constraints, such that an optimization is performed to provide robust trajectory estimation. Experiments show that the proposed system is able to create dense drift-free maps in real-time even running on an ultra-low power processor in featureless environments.},

  abstract  = {Numerous geolocation technologies, such as GPS, can pinpoint a person’s or object’s position on Earth under ideal conditions. However, autonomous navigation of mobile robots requires a precision localization system that can operate under a variety of environmental and resource constraints. Take for example an emergency response scenario where a hospital building is on fire. This is a time sensitive life or death scenario where it is critical for first responders to locate possible survivors in a smoke filled room. The robot’s sensors need to work past environmental occlusions such as excessive smoke, debris, etc to provide support to the first responders. The robot itself also needs to effectively and accurately navigate the room with minimal help from other agents that might be present in the building since it is unrealistic to deploy unlimited robots for this task. The available resources need to be effectively used to best aid the rescue crew and ensure the safety of the rescue workers.
Scenarios such as this present a crucial need for solutions that can work effectively in the presence of environmental constraints that can interfere with a sensor while giving equal weighting to resource constraints that impact the localization ability of a robot. This thesis presents one such experimentally proven solution that offers superior accuracy, robustness and scalability demonstrated via several realworld robot experiments and simulations.
The geolocation technique explored uses a recently discovered sensor technology called the ranging radios that are able to communicate and measure range in the absence of line-of-sight between radio nodes. This provides a straightforward approach to tackle unknown occlusions in the environment and enables the use of range to localize the agent in a variety of different situations. One shortcoming of range-only data created by these ranging radios is that they generate a nonlinear and multi-modal measurement distribution that existing estimation techniques fail to accurately and efficiently model. To overcome this shortcoming, a novel and robust method for localization and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) given range-only data to stationary feature/nodes is developed and presented here.
In addition to this centralized filtering technique, two key extensions are investigated and experimentally proven in order to provide a comprehensive framework for geolocation with range. The first is a decentralized filtering technique that distributes computational needs across several agents. This technique is especially useful in real-world scenarios where leveraging a large number of agents in an environment is not unrealistic. The second is a novel cooperative localization strategy, based on first principles, that leverages the motion of mobile agents in the system to provide better accuracy in a featureless environment. This technique is useful in cases where a limited number of mobile agents need to coordinate with each other to mutually improve their estimates.
The developed techniques offer a unified global framework for geolocation with range that spans everything from static network localization to multi-robot cooperative localization with a level of accuracy and robustness which no other existing techniques can provide.},

- Additionally, it is assumed that a constant variance model or a pre-calibrated PDF (probability distribution function) is available for the range sensor that is being used by the system.
- In other words, given that each node is identified with an unique ID and each observation provides the IDs of the two nodes involved in generating the measurement, we also know with perfect certainty to which pair of nodes the range observation corresponds.
- These observations are important because, they require that any filtering technique designed to solve the range-only localization problem needs to accurately model both nonlinear and multi-modal distributions. (Figure 3.1)
- One of the most commonly used methods for range-only localization is the standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which we call the Cartesian EKF. Odometry and gyro measurements are used in the state propagation or the prediction step, while the range measurements are incorporated in the correction step. While many alternative filtering techniques for performing range-only localization exists (such as particle filtering and batch optimization techniques), we will use the standard Cartesian EKF since it is by far the most similar to the method proposed in this thesis.
- Unlike the standard Cartesian EKF formulation, the ROP-EKF does not require the robot’s initial pose to be known.
- Thus far, we have assumed an unimodal Gaussian model, capable of approximating the nonlinearities within single range observations. We have also presented a probabilistic filtering method that is well suited for an EKF-based robot localization system. While this approach deals with non-linearities of an annulus, it fails to adequately deal with the multi-modal distribution of the system ((Figure 3.4(d))).
- Multi-Hypothesis Filter: To elaborate, whenever an annulus is split into separate modes, we simply duplicate the filter and adjust the mean of each hypothesis to represent the two distinct intersection points.},

They allow us to treat, in a principled way, any type of probability distribution, nonlinearity and non-stationarity. They have appeared in several fields under such names as "condensation", "sequential Monte Carlo" and "survival of the fittest". In this paper, we show how we can exploit the structure of the DBN to increase the efficiency of particle filtering, using a technique known as RaoBlackwellisation. Essentially, this samples some of the variables, and marginalizes out the rest exactly, using the Kalman filter, HMM filter, junction tree algorithm, or any other finite dimensional optimal filter. We show that RaoBlackwellised particle filters (RBPFs) lead to more accurate estimates than standard PFs. We demonstrate RBPFs on two problems, namely non-stationary online regression with radial basis function networks and robot localization and map building. We also discuss other potential application areas and provide references to some finite dimensional optimal filters.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents methods of localization using cooperating landmarks (beacons) that provide the ability to measure range only. Recent advances in radio frequency technology make it possible to measure range between inexpensive beacons and a transponder. Such a method has tremendous benefit since line of sight is not required between the beacons and the transponder, and because the data association problem can be completely avoided. If the positions of the beacons are known, measurements from multiple beacons can be combined using probability grids to provide an accurate estimate of robot location. This estimate can be improved by using Monte Carlo techniques and Kalman filters to incorporate odometry data. Similar methods can be used to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM) when beacon locations are uncertain. Experimental results are presented for robot localization. Tracking and SLAM algorithms are demonstrated in simulation.},

- In Section 2, we investigate the problem of robot localization in an environment with known beacon locations using Markovian probability grids. Experimental results are presented. Section 3 extends these ideas to position tracking using Kalman filtering and Monte Carlo localization. Section 4 addresses the problem of localization in an environment with uncertain beacon locations. Here we present a SLAM algorithm that combines intuition with Kalman filtering. Simulation results are given for position tracking and SLAM algorithms.},

Due to the exchange of multiple frames per ranging, two-way ranging has significant downsides in terms of scalability. This paper proposes and validates a novel approach for a multi-user time-difference of arrival based localization system using wireless clock synchronization. The system accuracy is assessed using a complex experiment, covering robotic movement and an optical reference system for comparable results. It is shown, that the accuracies achievable by time-difference of arrival positioning with wireless clock synchronization are comparable to similar two-way ranging based approaches.

After measuring only three of these distances (radii), an enhanced trilateration algorithm is applied to obtain X and Y coordinates in a Cartesian plane, i.e., the position of the robot on the factory floor. The embedded systems developed for the anchors and the robot are robust enough to establish communication, select the closest anchors for measuring radii, and identify in which of the grid zones the robot is located.},

In comparison with outdoor environments, sensing location information in indoor environments requires a higher precision and is a more challenging task in part because various objects reflect and disperse signals. Ultra WideBand (UWB) is an emerging technology in the field of indoor positioning that has shown better performance compared to others. In order to set the stage for this work, we provide a survey of the state-of-the-art technologies in indoor positioning, followed by a detailed comparative analysis of UWB positioning technologies. We also provide an analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to analyze the present state of UWB positioning technologies. While SWOT is not a quantitative approach, it helps in assessing the real status and in revealing the potential of UWB positioning to effectively address the indoor positioning problem. Unlike previous studies, this paper presents new taxonomies, reviews some major recent advances, and argues for further exploration by the research community of this challenging problem space.},

Wireless sensor signal outage and severe multipath propagation very often lead to ranging errors, which make pure UWB-based localization less effective. Moreover, inertial sensors have their drift with time. A tightly coupled system is uesd to estimate moving target position and attitude in the indoor conditions. In order to eliminate the clock error, Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) approach is used. Dynamic and static tests are carried on for the tightly coupled approach. Experimental results show that the tightly coupled indoor positioning system can improve the single system position accuracy and achieve the position and attitude real-time tracking of moving targets.},

Research in UWB is still in its infancy stages, offering limited resources in handling the challenges facing the UWB communications. Understanding the unique properties and challenges of UWB communications as well as its application in competent signal processing techniques are vital in conquering the obstacles towards developing exciting UWB applications. UWB research and development has to cope with the challenges that limit their performance, capacity, throughput, network flexibility, implementation complexity, and cost.

Landmark initialization is a critical issue in range-only SLAM due to the lack of bearing information from the robot to the landmarks. A new state vector is proposed to be used in solving the range-only SLAM. In the new state vector, the landmark position is represented in different ways under different situations. This new representation avoids the need of multiple hypotheses on the landmark positions implemented in most of the existing range-only SLAM algorithms. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new range-only SLAM algorithm using the new state vector within the least squares framework.},
